## My process

-I started by structuring my html so i can style it with css
-My initial process is to layout is build out from the body of the document first and then place the card on the page.
- Once the background and card are added, I then look to flex box to center the component.
- Once the component is centered, I roughly add all the content to the card to get the basic layout
- Once the basic layout is complete, I start with sizing the image and the adding padding and margins to the inner content.
- I like to use internal card body divs to such as content and header to align text content with in the card.
- Then after I have the UI 90 percent complete, I refactor all sizes to close as spec as possible.
- Once everything looks close, I will add the drop shadow to the card.
- Finally I will double check the mobile dimensions and make specific media query changes if needed.


### Built with

It helped me get more used html and css and also helped me get started with building real life projects 

### Continued development

I will continue to use frontend mentor as I learn frontend development and design. For future development I look to get more into CSS grid for the more advanced layouts and landing page challanges  and also give me concept on how to tackle challenges 

### Useful resources

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - This helped me for validation reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward and help me crosscheck errors in my html code 
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - This is an amazing stuff which helped me finally understand how to check errors im my code. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
